# Image-Compression-Using-K-means-Clustering-Algorithm


Image compression is minimizing the size in bytes of a graphics file without degrading the quality of the image to an unacceptable level. The reduction in file size allows more images to be stored in a given amount of disk or memory space

Built an image compression application using k-means clustering unsupervised learning algorithm using scikit-learn and Python
